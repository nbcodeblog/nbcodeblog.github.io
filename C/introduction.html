    <h1>Introduction of C Language</h1>
    <h2>What is C ?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.</li>
        <li>It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.</li>
        <li>C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Learn C ?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</li>
        <li>If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python, etc, as the syntax is similar</li>
        <li>C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.</li>
        <li>C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.</li>
        <li>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Text Editor</h2>
    <p>A text editor to write C code.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Text Editors</th>
            <th><abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr></th>

        <tr>
            <td>Notepad</td>
            <td>Windows</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Compilers</h2>
    <p>A compiler to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Compiler</th>
            <th><abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr></th>

        <tr>
            <td>GCC</td>
            <td>Cross Platform</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2><abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr></h2>
    <p>An <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> is used to edit AND compile the code.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>IDE</th>
